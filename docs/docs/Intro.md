# What is capy?
---

Capy stand for **Compact Application Platform "Yggdrasil"**. It is a framework used to make lightweight native wayland applications.

Usderlying structure of capy is a tree (that is where "Yggdrasil" comes from). Everyting in capy is a node of a tree called a **widget**. So to create any app you just need to describe a tree, and everything else is handled by th framework.

//TODO: more description?
